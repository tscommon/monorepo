# [Mutex](https://tscommon.github.io/monorepo/primitives/async/mutex)

A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data.

This mutex will block async contexts waiting for the lock to become available. The mutex can be created via a new constructor. Each mutex has a type parameter which represents the data that it is protecting. The data can only be accessed through the RAII guards returned from `lock` and `tryLock`, which guarantees that the data is only ever accessed when the mutex is locked.
